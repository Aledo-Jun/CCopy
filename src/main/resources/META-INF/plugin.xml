    C++ Includes Expander is a CLion plugin designed to streamline competitive programming on online judges. When you copy C++ code that contains local include directives, the plugin automatically replaces those includes with the actual code from the referenced files. This makes your copied code fully self-contained and ready to compile, eliminating the hassle of managing multiple source files.

    Key features include:
    • **Automatic Include Expansion:** Recursively processes local include statements to inline their contents, ensuring that your code can be compiled as a standalone unit.
    • **Dependency Management:** Constructs an include tree to prevent duplicate inclusions and maintain the correct order, while intelligently stripping out redundant include guards.
    • **Selective Processing:** System headers (e.g., &lt;iostream&gt;, &lt;algorithm&gt;) are left untouched, while known local headers are handled appropriately.
    • **Customizable Behavior:** Easily toggle the functionality on/off and configure a custom shortcut for the copy command through the plugin settings.

    This tool is ideal for competitive programmers who need to quickly generate single-file submissions for online judges.
